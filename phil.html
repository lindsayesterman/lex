  <div id="introduction">
    <h2>About my mom:</h2>
    <p>Tracy Esterman (<em>mom</em>) is a go-getter. She takes <strong>initiative</strong>. If you need something done (that doesn't have to be perfect), she is the person for you! Tracy sticks up for what she believes in. No is never an answer. The principle of things is what matters most. So, that means if someone charges us one dollar more than they are supposed to, the manager is called and the check voided. </p>
