    <p>Happy mothers day mom! I'm so thankful I've had you as my best friend throughout this weird year. I know
        we've argued a lot lately, but we've also laughed a lot. A lot, a lot. Our times reading mama's jar of
        memories and singing Beetlejuice together have been the only things keeping me wanting to come out of my room every day. Thanks for
        keeping me sane - I love you. </p>
